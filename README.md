# Recipe Tracking App

This is recipe tracking app from Chegg Skills. It's a CRUD application where a user can add and delete recipes. 

It was made using React and basic CSS. 

The main idea of the app is to have the user create a new recipe and then delete if they choose to. 

One of the criteria towards passing the tests was to add a new component that was going to be used for in `RecipeList.js`. For this part of the project, I decided to make the `RecipeRowItem.js` component. This component renders a single table row.
